# Smooth-Pursuit-Eye-Simulation-3D

I have used work of Hsu. et al.(1976) Nonlinear reciprocal innervation saccade model and adapt it to smooth eye movement.
In order to run saved simulation one can run animationscript.m. 
If you want to simulate yourself u can use EyeScript and can change box position etc.
